# Intro to Programming through Game Development
## ...or, how I learned to stop worrying and LÃ–VE Lua

## What is this?
This repository will contain the sample code and prewritten libraries for
the class I'm teaching in the Fall of 2012.

You can view my written guides for Intro to Programming here:

## What will this repo contain?

Various chapters in the guide will have some sample code in it.
I would like to keep that code in here.

Additionally, concepts like physics, collision detection, or even
map loading might be a bit hard for the students to grasp, so I
am planning on writing small Lua libraries for these ahead of time
for students to use.


## Who is this geared for?

The examples in here, and the guide itself, is geared for children
and teenagers. Generally, younger-people with little to no programming
experience.

As such, this guide will not contain the secrets of the universe
or anything *too* fancy. It is mainly meant as a way to get kids
familiar with basic programming concepts, up to probably functions.
