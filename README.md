# Intro to Programming through Game Development
## ...or, how I learned to stop worrying and LÖVE Lua

## What is this?
This repository will contain the sample code and prewritten libraries for
the class I'm teaching in the Fall of 2012.

You can view my written guides for Intro to Programming here:

## What will this repo contain?

Various chapters in the guide will have some sample code in it.
I would like to keep that code in here.

Additionally, concepts like physics, collision detection, or even
map loading might be a bit hard for the students to grasp, so I
am planning on writing small Lua libraries for these ahead of time
for students to use.
