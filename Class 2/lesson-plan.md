# Last time...

* Setting up LOVE
* Game Loop
* Writing Text
* Variables
* Moving Text
* If Statements
* Loading Graphics

# Prepare

* Large poster board - Reference sheet of LOVE functions covered so far
* Filmstrip visual aid
* Collision Detection code
* Sample code to reference during class
* Draw a couple simple tank sprites, maybe background tile

# Overview

1. Review Exercise: Using If Statements, Graphics, and Variables before moving on
2. Additional usages for If Statements
3. LOVE: Getting Input
4. Exercise: Make a program where you move around, and press a button to change speed
5. Discuss: How might AI figure out what to do?
6. Exercise: Add NPC that moves around
7. Discuss: What might be a goal for the game we have so far? Collecting items?
8. Exercise: Add an item. Use prewritten function to see if player/NPC touch item.
9. Discuss: What does the Player, NPC, and Item have in common (X, Y, image, …)
10. Lua: Tables
11. Exercise: Fix program so that Player, NPC, and Item are stored in Tables.
12. What does this mean? Why do this?
    a. Think of it as explicitly saying “this belongs to...”
    b. New set of variables within an object
    c. Can pass around the object instead of the variables
13. Conceptualizing verbs as functionality (“Move”, “Attack”, etc.)
14. Lua: Functions
15. Exercise: Creating MOVE functions, etc.
16. Discuss: All the enemies in a game, how tedious it would be to update everybody like that
17. Lua: Arrays
18. Exercise: Update program with NPC arrays


If we still have time after this, probably just have “free work” time.
Challenges:

* Draw or tile a background image to add in
* Add score w/ text output
* Add an end to the game (if score = 10...)
* Adding two players


Filmstrips next week, doesn’t really seem to fit today.
